# PROJECT NO LONGER ACTIVE #
We recommend you take a look at [VirtueMart](http://www.virtuemart.net/) which is based on phpShop and is actively developed.  If you are interested in continuing the original code development please contact the group for developer access.

# What is phpShop? #
phpShop is a PHP-powered shopping cart application. It is released under the GNU General Public License.

The primary purpose of phpShop is to provide a simple shopping cart solution that is easy to customize to suit any purpose. phpShop has less features that many other shopping cart applications, but is generally easier to customize.

All that is required to effectively customize phpShop is a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.
