modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are
met:

1. Redistributions in source code must retain the above copyright

2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
   notice, this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer in
   the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
   distribution.

3. Edikon Corporation requests that attribution be given to phpShop
   in any manner possible. phpShop includes a "Powered by phpShop"
   button that is installed by default. While it is not a license
   violation to remove this button, it is requested that the
   attribution remain. A significant investment has been put
   into phpShop, and this effort will continue if the phpShop community
   continues to grow. This is one way to assure that growth.

4. All advertising materials and documentation mentioning
   features derived from or use of this software must display
   the following acknowledgement:

     "This product includes software developed by Edikon Corporation
     for use in phpShop. (http://www.phpShop.org/)."

   In the event that the product being advertised includes an
   intact phpShop distribution (with copyright and license included)
   then this clause is waived.

5. Names associated with phpShop or Edikon Corporation must not be used to
   endorse or promote products derived from this software without
   prior written permission from Edikon Corporation.

6. Modified redistributions of any form whatsoever must retain
   the following acknowledgment:

     "This product includes software developed by Edikon Corporation
     for use in phpShop. (http://www.phpShop.org/)."

   Intact (re-)distributions of any official phpShop release do not
   require an external acknowledgement.

7. Modifications are encouraged but must be packaged separately as
   patches to official phpShop releases.  Distributions that do not
   clearly separate the patches from the original work must be clearly
   labeled as unofficial distributions.  Modifications which do not
   carry the name phpShop may be packaged in any form, as long as they
   conform to all of the clauses above.
